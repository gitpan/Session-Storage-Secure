0.005     2013-02-01 13:55:34 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

0.004     2013-01-25 15:10:34 America/New_York

    [CHANGES]

    - Seeding is now done by Crypt::URandom, which uses the best
      non-blocking source of random data on a given platform, including
      Win32

0.003     2013-01-17 08:47:45 America/New_York

    [BUG FIXES]

    - ISAAC is now seeded from /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random to avoid
      blocking.  urandom is sufficient for seeding a CPRNG that itself is
      generating salt to permute the actual secret key.
